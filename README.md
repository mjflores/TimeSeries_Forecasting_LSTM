# Forecasting_LSTM

This program performs time series forecasting using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model on a simulated multivariate dataset. 
It applies a supervised learning approach by transforming the time series into input-output pairs based on a specified window size. 
The model is trained to predict the next value in the sequence, making it a one-step-ahead forecast. This setup is particularly 
useful for capturing temporal dependencies and trends within the data. The simulation allows for controlled experimentation and 
evaluation of the LSTMâ€™s ability to learn and generalize from sequential patterns in univariate time series forecasting tasks.

# Synthetic Time Series Data Generator
The file generar_series_temporales.py defines a Python class for generating synthetic time series data for meteorological variables: 
atmospheric pressure, temperature, and wind speed. 

The generator creates realistic data by mimicking daily and yearly cycles, adding trends, and incorporating random noise.

# LSTM model
The modelo_LSTM.py file contains the core classes and logic for time series forecasting using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network. It includes:

> DatasetLSTM: Prepares and normalizes meteorological data (pressure, temperature, wind) for LSTM training, transforming it into supervised learning input-output pairs.
> ModeloLSTM: Defines a custom LSTM network with two stacked layers, dropout regularization, and a fully connected output layer for predicting wind speed.
> EntrenadorLSTM: Manages LSTM model training and evaluation, including early stopping and loss tracking, using PyTorch.
Use this script to configure, train, and evaluate your LSTM model for multivariate time series forecasting tasks.
